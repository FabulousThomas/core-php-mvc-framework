            <p>
                  The "core-php-mvc-framework" is a lightweight PHP MVC framework that is designed to be easy to use and highly customizable. It follows the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern, which separates application logic, data, and presentation. The framework is built on Core PHP, and it provides a set of libraries and tools that can be used to build web applications quickly and efficiently.

                  A lightweight and flexible PHP framework designed to build robust, scalable and maintainable web applications using the Model View Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
                  The Core PHP MVC (Model View Controller) framework allows developers to build dynamic websites using the Model-View-Controller design pattern in PHP.
            </p>

            <p>
                  One of the key features of the "core-php-mvc-framework" is its modular design, which allows developers to easily extend and customize the framework to meet their specific needs. The framework is built using best practices and follows industry standards, making it a reliable and secure choice for building web applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                  In addition to its modular design, the "core-php-mvc-framework" also provides a number of built-in features that can help developers save time and effort. These features include a template engine, a database abstraction layer, and a set of helper functions and libraries.

            <ol>
                  <li>
                        Template engine:
                        The framework includes a template engine that can be used to create dynamic and responsive web pages.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                        Database abstraction layer:
                        <ul>
                              <li>
                                    The framework provides a database abstraction layer that can be used to interact with different types of databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                    Connects to databases using PDO (PHP Data Objects).
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                    Provides methods for executing queries, binding parameters, and retrieving results.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                    The database abstraction layer also includes methods for handling transactions, prepared statements, and error handling.
                              </li>
                        </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Set of helper functions and libraries:
                        <ul>
                              <li>
                                    Functions for handling user sessions, cookies, form data, etc.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                    The framework includes a set of helper functions and libraries that can be used to perform common tasks, such as authentication, authorization, and pagination
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                    These libraries can be easily extended or replaced with custom implementations.
                              </li>
                        </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                        Class autoloader:
                        <ul>
                              <li>
                                    Automatically loads classes when they are called in your code. This means you don't need to include or require files manually - the framework will do it for you automatically.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                    This makes it easier to organize your project into multiple files without having to include each file manually.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                    This reduces the need to include files manually with require or include statements.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                    This eliminates the need to include or require each class individually.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                    Automatically loads classes when they are called in the code: This makes it easier to organize your project into multiple files without having to include each file individually. This feature is not available in PHP 5.2 and older versions.
                              </li>
                              <li>
